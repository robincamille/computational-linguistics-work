# About 

This function was created for a homework assignment (below). It includes the specific data that I define but could be adapted for use elsewhere.

1. Represent a joint occurrence between two categorical variables in python as a nested dictionary structure. Call this variable “joint”.

2. Write a function inc(joint, x, y) that increments the count of x and y in the joint probability table. 

3. Write a function prob(joint, x, y) that calculates the joint probability of the events “x” and “y” as stored in the variable “joint”. 

4. Write two function marginalX(joint, x) and marginalY(joint, y) that calculates the marginal probability of the events “x”, and “y”, respectively.

5. Write a function, condXY(joint, x, y), that calculates the conditional probability of p(x|y). 

6. Write a function, condYX(joint, y, x), that calculates the conditional probability of   p(y|x). [code does not do this properly]
